<h2> Technologistsâ€™ Competency in Computed Tomography (CT) Practice in Salmaniya Medical Complex: A Self-Based Assessment  </h2>
<h3> Background </h3>
 <h4> Competency in computed tomography (CT) practice is essential to ensure high quality imaging and minimize radiation dose.  In Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC), differences in educational and training backgrounds among its CT technologists have raised concerns about in educational and training backgrounds among its CT technologists have raised concerns about 


the standardization of CT practice. </h4>
<h3> Aim </h3>
 <h4> To assess the competency level of CT technologists in SMC and identify factors 
influencing their performance. </h4>
<h3>Method</h3>
<h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 33 CT technologists at SMC using a 
self-assessment questionnaire.  The study examined competency levels across three domains: 
patient care and communication, radiation safety and protection, and image production and 
optimization.  Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive and non-parametric tests, 
including Wilcoxon Signed-Rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.</h4>
<h3>Result</h3>
<h4> Competency scores across all domains were significantly below the satisfactory 
threshold (p < 0.05).  Radiation safety scored the lowest, while patient care and communication 
scored the highest.  Demographic factors, including education and years of experience, showed no 
significant influence on competency.  Interest in continuous professional development was 
positively associated with competency levels. </h4>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>The findings highlight a critical need for targeted training programs to address 
competency gaps in CT practice.  In addition, a national postgraduate program and mandatory 
licensing could ensure consistent competency levels among technologists in Bahrain.</h4>
